I have created this Project to practice html css and javascript .
and Know how websites work .
=> It is a simple static wabpage that is created using HTML ,CSS , JAVASCRIPT and some other tools like bootstrap and all.
=>In this Webpage we tried to mimic spotify website .
=> In this we added some songs that can be controlled by manualy and changed by the given buttons.
And Many more things are also there........
